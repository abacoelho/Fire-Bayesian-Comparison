# Lightning vs. Human-Ignited Fires: A Bayesian Comparison
**Abstract**    
Fires are a prevalent aspect of living in California. This research examined the differences in the ignition conditions of fires caused by lightning compared to those caused by humans. A Bayesian method was implemented to compare the distributions of the variables of the two groups. The distributions of the ignition day’s maximum temperature and average windspeed, and the location’s distance from highway were predicted. The results demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups.



This figure (generated from the BEST package in R) is for the maximum temperature for lightning-caused (group 1) and human-caused (group 2). On the left, the histograms are plots of the 1,000 samples from the chain of the marginal posterior distribution for each parameter. The two top-right plots have a histogram of the true sample values overlayed on the predicted posterior distributions. The middle-right two graphs are of the difference in the groups mean and standard deviation, and the bottom-right is the effect size for the 1,000 chain samples.
